# Code created for my participation in Hack for the Future Hackathon  2021

### The idea is to create a website called "Nauchi.me" where students can go when they have questions regarding educational topics. These can then be answered by the teachers on the platform, and help the children with any difficult homework, lessons or simply wanting to develop their competences.
